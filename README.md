# Light Data Visualisation Tool (LDVT)

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This tool is purely demonstrative allowing the user to learn how most of data Visualisation tools are made.
 
 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, I've tried to explain the source code as well as possible to help beginners create their own visualization elements. I have also included a "Hello World" example to encourage learners to explore this method of building web applications.
 
 
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to understand how this tool works, please open each file and read the comments inside. First start wit "start.me" file in which you will find how this tool is starting and hosting the server. This is important beacuse I use Python SimpleHTTPServer and not Apache.
 
 
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simply start the tool, open a browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ to start using the tool. Read the About page to understand what demonstration is made in which page. Have fun learning.
