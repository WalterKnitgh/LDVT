# Light Data Visualisation Tool (LDVT)

This tool is purely demonstrative allowing the user to learn how most of data Visualisation tools are made. At the same time, I've tried to explain the source code as well as possible to help beginners create their own visualization elements. I have also included a "Hello World" example to encourage learners to explore this method of building web applications.
